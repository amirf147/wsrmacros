I would like to express my profound gratitude to @leeorhelps for his invaluable contributions to the field of Windows Speech Recognition macros with his project at https://github.com/leeorhelps/SpeechBird. His comprehensive collection of macros, generously shared on GitHub, has been instrumental in my understanding of how Windows Speech Recognition macros function. Without his pioneering work, the progress Iâ€™ve made would not have been possible. Thank you, Leeor, for your significant role in this journey.
